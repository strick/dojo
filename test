EXCEL
Thank you for submitting your application to the University of Central Florida's EXCEL program. EXCEL applications are reviewed by the selections committee every two weeks and decisions are made on a rolling basis. Based on the volume of submissions, the selections committee may not be able to review all applications at each meeting. 
Students should check their EXCEL admission status regularly throughout the process as a status can change when additional information is submitted (i.e., math scores/grades). You may check your application status online at http://excel.ucf.edu/status using your NID and NID password. Your status message will provide instructions for the next steps in your application process. 
EXCEL admissions occur in a two-phased process: (1) accepted on initial review and (2) final acceptance. Candidates who are accepted through the first phase will need to complete the UCF Math Placement Test (MPT) before being considered for final acceptance in the EXCEL learning community. No applicant is guaranteed a spot until the student confirms “Final Acceptance”. 
The UCF Math Placement Test (MPT) is required of all students entering UCF. Students are encouraged to take the MPT at their earliest convenience for consideration as a member of EXCEL. EXCEL students must score at least College Algebra or higher placement for consideration for the program. The exam is rigorous and should be taken with the same sincerity and respect as a standardized exam (i.e., CLEP, SAT, ACT). The exam tests your algebra and trigonometry skills only. For this reason, if you are enrolled in a senior calculus course you do not need to wait until you have completed the course to take the MPT. More information on the exam can be found at http://utc.sdes.ucf.edu/math/incoming.
NOTE: Students who are interested in on-campus EXCEL housing must apply to housing through Housing and Residence Life (http://www.housing.ucf.edu) and complete the Living Learning Community application for “EXCEL/COMPASS”. This does not guarantee you a spot in the block housing, but places you on the list for consideration.
If you have questions about the EXCEL program please do not hesitate to contact us at excel@ucf.edu.
Thank you for your application!
